## About Me
I am a student at **Horace Mann School** and the **Columbia Science Honors Program (SHP)**. My work focuses on pushing the limits of 3D-printed robots through integrated thermal management and robust structural design. I have a background in CS as a USACO Gold competitor and ML enthousiast. 
My current research interests are **legged robot design and optimization**, **reinforcement learning for legged robot control**, and **soft robots**.

## Research

### Low-Cost, High performance Actuator Design: 3D Printed Water-Cooled QDD Actuator

I designed, manufactured, and tested a 3D printed **Quasi-Direct Drive (QDD)** actuator that achieves near-metal torque (peak and continuous) levels using a custom water-cooling loop. The project is submitted for Terra STEM Fair 2026.

* **Continuous Torque:** Optimized thermal management to double the continuous torque limit compared to previous 3D-printed actuators.
* **Design:** Custom cycloidal planetary gearbox (7.2:1) with a custom outrunner BLDC motor. Calculated bearing loads and optimized core actuator components.

## Computer Science
### Competitive Programming: USACO Gold division
* Top ~15% of pre-college coders nationally.
* Heavy experience in algorithms (graphs, DP, bitmasks, etc.)

### ML and Web Development
* Used machine learning and pathfinding algorithms to develop a health diagnostic web application and an in-store retail navigation web prototype for Horace Mann Startups and Service Club.
* Researching reinforcement learning for legged robot control
